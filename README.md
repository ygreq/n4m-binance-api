# n4m-binance-api
This is a repository for a Node for Max implementation (https://cycling74.com/) 
of the Binance API (https://github.com/binance-exchange/binance-official-api-docs) 
via this node.js project (https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-binance-api)

It does not do much yet. Check the to do board to see what I would like to see implemented. Maybe you can help. I really appreciate it.  

Installation guide

Clone or download the project. You have all that you need in this repository. 

Warning

There is an option in the binance.js file to write your API keys in order to use this in more advanced ways. Like buying and selling. Please be sure not to share that file in case you input your private data there. As a feature hopefully me or someone else will put that code in another file. So you would know not to share that specific file along with the rest of the project.
